Week 2
Since my exploration of the possible databases to help me with this assignment was not as helpful as i could have 
hoped i decided to try to go down a different route and try and analyse a google maps image to determine where the 
roads where and how wide they were. My first approach to this was to try and get satelite images and try and
determine where roads where, but encounted difficulties in accounting for tunnels and dirt roads and such. I then 
decided to see if i could get google to do the work for me and see how far i could push the google API in accounting
for roads. What i managed to do was discover the API that let you save static images of a defined area of the world,
but with a lot of restricutions and changes you could make to the map. Such as defining its size precisly and removing
unwanted elements as well as well as changing the colours of other elements.

SO once I had this capability I started on a progam that takes in a street address or landmark and returns a ~1km
square area with everything but roads blacked out and roads a stark white.

Next week I will work on taking that image i have managed to generate and then parsing it so that my code can count
the number of white pixels to black pixels, and so work out the total area of road their is in the given area.
